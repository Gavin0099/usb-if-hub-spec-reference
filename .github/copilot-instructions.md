## DONE Boundary Rules (MANDATORY)

### Rule 1: Hard Stop After DONE

When the defined DONE condition is met, stop immediately.

Do NOT automatically continue into:
- full regression or broad smoke validation
- governance artifact chains (`triage -> decision -> contract -> gate -> acceptance -> freeze`)
- commit, push, closeout, or status rollup
- inspection of unrelated dirty or untracked files

Report next options only. Wait for explicit instruction.

### Rule 2: Scope-Matched Validation

Run targeted validation first.

Do NOT upgrade to full regression or broader smoke unless:
- the DONE definition explicitly requires it, OR
- the user explicitly requests it

When broader validation fails: report the failure and classification in one message, then stop.
Do not build triage/decision/contract chains from a broader validation failure.

### Rule 3: Dirty Tree Allowlist

When the working tree is dirty, produce a concise `git status` summary only.

Stage only files explicitly listed by the user or required by the DONE scope.
Do not read, explain, stage, or modify unrelated dirty or untracked files.

### Rule 4: Structured Report Format

When reporting task completion, use this exact format. Fixed vocabulary only; no free-form narrative in these fields.

Vocabulary definitions:
- `NOT PRESENT` = the mechanism, artifact, or enforcement does not exist
- `NOT CLAIMED` = the capability or conclusion is not being asserted this session
- `PASS` = must always include `— <command or source>` (never bare)

```text
Validation:
- structural:    PASS — <command> | FAIL — <command> | NOT RUN
- build:         PASS — <command> | FAIL — <command> | NOT RUN
- semantic:      NOT CLAIMED | PASS — human review: [reviewer/date]
- behavioral:    NOT PRESENT | verified — [how]
- ext evidence:  NOT PRESENT | [source and scope]

Risk:
- scope drift:        none | [description]
- claim inflation:    none | [description]
- evidence maturity:  [one line]

Incidental cleanup:   none | file=[path] reason=[why] semantic_change=no

Cannot claim this session:
- [list what was NOT validated, NOT verified, NOT proven]
```

Do NOT omit `Cannot claim`. It is required in every completion report.

### Golden Examples

Schema-only change:

```text
Validation:
- structural:    PASS — grep section_refs *.md
- build:         NOT RUN
- semantic:      NOT CLAIMED
- behavioral:    NOT PRESENT
- ext evidence:  NOT PRESENT
Risk:
- scope drift:        none
- claim inflation:    none
- evidence maturity:  structural layer only; no semantic verification
Incidental cleanup:   none
Cannot claim this session:
- semantic correctness of section references
- PDF-level content verification
```

Pilot attachment change:

```text
Validation:
- structural:    PASS — validate_wiki_frontmatter
- build:         PASS — npm.cmd run build
- semantic:      NOT CLAIMED
- behavioral:    NOT PRESENT
- ext evidence:  NOT PRESENT
Risk:
- scope drift:        none — pilot limited to existing entries
- claim inflation:    none — claim_level unchanged (inferred)
- evidence maturity:  build-verified only; no PDF-backed semantic verification
Incidental cleanup:   none
Cannot claim this session:
- bit-level semantic verification of attached spec sections
- verified status upgrade
```

Failed / partial validation:

```text
Validation:
- structural:    PASS — validate_wiki_frontmatter
- build:         FAIL — npm.cmd run build
- semantic:      NOT CLAIMED
- behavioral:    NOT PRESENT
- ext evidence:  NOT PRESENT
Risk:
- scope drift:        none
- claim inflation:    none — task not complete
- evidence maturity:  build failure; no completion evidence
Incidental cleanup:   none
Cannot claim this session:
- task complete
- any validation above build layer
```
